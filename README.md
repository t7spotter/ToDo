This Todo application is built using Django and Django Rest Framework. It provides users with the ability to create, view, edit, and delete tasks (Todo items). The 'todo' model is used to store task information, and the 'TodoView' and 'TodoDetailView' views are used to create the user interface and interact with the database.

To install and run this application with docker, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
  ```git clone https://github.com/t7spotter/ToDo-App.git```

3. Navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment (if necessary).

4. Run:
  ```docker-compose up```
